# Report for week 5

**Hours: 15**

### Stuff done during this week:

- Benchmarking
  - Completely refactored the benchmarking (JUnit 5 Parameterized Tests)
  - More benchmarks, for example: BitSets
- Algorithm
  - BitSet[] algorithm (CelluralMapHandlerBit) for comparison
  - Abstract class (CelluralMapAbstract) to help with benchmarking
  - Fixed anomalies pointed out by a peer review
- GUI
  - Image zooming
  - Organized code
- Documentation
  - More JavaDoc
  - Improved testing document
    
### Problems

A small issue with the LongField was found ([here](https://github.com/Luukuton/Ryuuri-tiralab2021/issues/1)). 
Nothing too serious and doesn't really have anything to do with this course. 
There's a "FIXME" tag with some information in [LongField.java](https://github.com/Luukuton/Ryuuri-tiralab2021/blob/main/src/main/java/ryuuri/ui/LongField.java).

### Next week

Most likely a lot more comparisons with the performance now that I have a great benchmarking system in place. Maybe graphs too.
