# Report for week 1

- Language: Java (11) with Gradle
- Topic: Dungeon Generator

**Hours: 1** + the time used for deciding the topic.

During this week I used most of my hours to make my mind on the topic I'm going to work on. It was actually kinda hard to decide what to do. I'm still not completely sure about it, but it's probably fine.

Setting up Git, IntelliJ (IDE) etc. was routine for me, so not too much to say about that.

Next week I'll be starting the actual coding.
